    "description": "At 29 years old, I transitioned into the software testing field through a certified training course at OpenClassrooms. This course allowed me to earn a diploma in web development and integration while specializing in test automation and software quality management. My 18-month apprenticeship provided me with hands-on experience as a software tester, where I applied my skills to ensure the reliability of applications throughout their lifecycle. Although my main expertise lies in software testing, my knowledge of web development complements my skills for a comprehensive approach to quality. Curious, methodical, and passionate about technical challenges, I am ready to take on new projects that combine expertise in testing and development to deliver high-quality applications."
