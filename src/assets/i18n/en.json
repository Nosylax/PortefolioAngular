    "description": "At 29, I made a career change into software testing through a certified OpenClassrooms program. With a diploma in web development, I specialized in test automation and software quality. During my 18-month apprenticeship, I gained solid hands-on experience as a software tester. My development skills allow me to take a comprehensive approach to quality. Curious, detail-oriented, and passionate about tech challenges, Iâ€™m ready to take on new projects to help deliver reliable, high-performing applications."
